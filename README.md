# Welcome to the IOT_CarPark_Arduino wiki !

This project consists on creating a parking helper, a radar on the parking process.

Flow : when you are parking, if you get closer to another vehicle, its radar beeps, quicker depending on the distance, and flashing with the LEDs and a notification is sent to the owner of the touched vehicle.
